The project applies Data analytics techniques to present insight on Reducing traffic accidents which is an important public safety challenge. The Project uses **MS Excel** analysis tool. The Workbook contains a *data analysis sheet* and a *Dashboard.*

  *Data was taken from Kaggle.com Datasets. It contains **1.04 million** instances.
